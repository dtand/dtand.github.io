# About Me
My name is Daniel Anderson. I was born and raised in Ozark, Missouri, where I attended Ozark High School from kindergarten until 12th grade. I have always been a creative person. In grade school, I designed several board games, trading card games, and wrote stories. In fifth grade, I discovered "drag-and-drop" programming through RPG Maker, sparking a curiosity that grew into formal programming by high school and eventually a degree in Computer Science.

I was fortunate enough to have a very successful track and field career in high school—which got me all the way out to Washington, DC to join the track and field team at Georgetown University. While at Georgetown, I competed as a Division I track and field athlete in the 200-, 400-, and 800-meter events. My dedication to both athletics and academics was recognized with the [Thomas Francis Graham Award](https://guhoyas.com/news/2017/5/22/Anderson_and_Bartelsmeyer_Receive_University_Awards_), which honors a single student-athlete from the college for leadership and scholarship. During my time there, I also worked as a teaching assistant for three years, co-founded the Game Design Club, and co-authored research under Professor Justin Thaler on streaming algorithms ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07001)). At Georgetown, I graduated class of 2017 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.

Before my professional career kickstarted, I had the opportunity to intern two summers while I was in college. The summer of 2015, I interned at Cerner in Kansas City (now Oracle), where I worked on automating several processes used by the data warehousing team. The summer of 2017, I took on an interesting intern role at Systems and Technology Research (STR) in Woburn, MA. While with STR for the summer, I dove deep into a machine learning-based project where I leveraged RNNs to classify binary data. After STR, I had intended to return to Georgetown for my master's in Computer Science, but found that I was eager to start working and decided to save the money and go directly into the workforce.

Shortly after college, I took on a role at IBM as a Cognitive Consultant, where I worked with a range of technologies and directly with government clients to help launch and deploy software on-site. Shortly after IBM, I co-founded Travas Inc., where we built and deployed a full-stack application that enabled cryptocurrency trading strategy design and live deployment of automated trading bots. The startup was a huge turning point in my technical skillset and forced me to learn many intricacies of system design that I would not have learned until much later in my career. Travas lasted about a year until we decided to step away, and I took on a full-time role at S&C Electric Company.

Today I still work for S&C Electric company with the majority of my work ranging from enterprise applications to embedded systems. I spent my first five years contributing to enterprise applications and this past year on embedded systems. My career has been shaped by a passion for building reliable systems, solving complex problems, and continuously learning new technologies.

Outside of work, I'm deeply committed to running and endurance sports. My journey as a runner began in seventh grade and continued through college and post-collegiately. For the past four years, I have trained with the [Georgetown Running Club](https://www.grcrunning.com/) in Washington, DC. Running has taught me lessons that carry into every aspect of my life: time management, setting long-term goals, learning from setbacks, and striving for constant improvement both personally and professionally. 

When I'm not training for a big race, I enjoy many other pastimes. You can find me spending time with my partner Brenda, where we enjoy hiking, exploring new restaurants around the city, or relaxing at home watching a movie or TV series together. We have a 9-year-old rescue dog, Stella, who tests our patience every day but makes up for it with the joy and energy she brings to our home. When time permits and I'm feeling motivated to learn and build, I thoroughly enjoy diving into creative hobby projects—many of which are captured here on this site.

At my core, I'm a creative problem-solver who thrives on blending technical rigor with imagination. Whether it's architecting scalable systems, exploring embedded systems, or pushing myself in running, I'm driven by curiosity, resilience, and the pursuit of growth.
