# About Me
I'm a software engineer with over six years of experience at S&C Electric Company, where I've worked across enterprise application development and embedded engineering. My career has been shaped by a passion for building reliable systems, solving complex problems, and continuously learning new technologies.

Outside of engineering, I’m deeply committed to running and triathlons. Endurance sports have taught me lessons that carry into every aspect of my life: time management, setting long-term goals, learning from setbacks, and striving for constant improvement both personally and professionally.

My journey into technology began in grade school, where I designed board games, trading card games, and wrote stories. In fifth grade, I discovered “drag-and-drop” programming through RPG Maker, sparking a curiosity that grew into formal programming by high school and eventually a degree in Computer Science from Georgetown University (Class of 2017).

At Georgetown, I competed as a Division I track and field athlete in the 200, 400, and 800 meters. My dedication to both athletics and academics was recognized with the Thomas Francis Graham Award, honoring distinguished student-athletes for leadership and scholarship. During my time there, I also worked as a teaching assistant for three years, co-founded the Game Design Club, and co-authored research with Professor Justin Thaler on interactive proofs (published here).

At my core, I’m a creative problem-solver who thrives on blending technical rigor with imagination. Whether it’s architecting scalable systems, exploring embedded solutions, or pushing myself through endurance sports, I’m driven by curiosity, resilience, and the pursuit of growth.
