## Overview
A 2D game engine with basic physics and support for genetic algorithms.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: core language used for game engine and physics engine
- **SDL2**: graphics rendering and event handling

## Description
Godspeed game engine was a side project I started during the summer of 2014 before my sophomore year in college.  The project started as a 2D game engine, and eventually expanded to support genetic algorithm visualization.

The Godspeed Evolution Simulator demonstrates natural selection and genetic algorithms in a visual, interactive environment. Individuals with higher fitness values have better chances of passing their genes to the next generation, creating an evolving population that changes over time through crossover and mutation.

## Key Features
- Genetic Algorithm Implementation: Full genetic algorithm with selection, crossover, and mutation
- Fitness-Based Selection: Individuals with higher fitness values have proportionally better chances of reproduction
- Visual Representation: Each individual is represented as a colored entity on screen with randomly assigned RGB values
- Time-Based Evolution: World operates on a day/night cycle with mating occurring every 3 days
- Console Logging: Real-time feedback about births, mating, and population statistics
- Custom Game Engine: Built on the Godspeed Game Engine with support for game objects, rendering, and timing

## What I Learned
I learned various concepts during the development of this project. The main new concept I explored was genetic algorithms, which I had never used before. Additionally, I learned a lot about structuring and building a component-based game engine.
